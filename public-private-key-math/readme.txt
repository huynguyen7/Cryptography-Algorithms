Chapter 11
Basically, this chapter describes the Math for public-private key encryption for CONFIDENTIALITY assurance.
In chapter 9, we have seen the problem of Alice and Bob exchanging the public keys. Firstly, Alice sends Bob 1,000,000 public keys. Bob now choose one of them and send back to Alice. Malicious users now need to skim over all over the keys in order to know what Bob selected. Generally, Alice has to solve a really easy problem comparing to the malicious attackers when they need to try all possibilities.
